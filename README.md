A client for connecting to [vpngate.net](http://vpngate.net) OpenVPN servers.

**Features**:

- filters VPN servers by their geographical location (country or VPNs in Europe)
- probes the VPN endpoints to detect ones that aren't responding for some reason
  before connecting to the VPN server
- once connected, performs a speed-test for the VPN and lets you decide if the
  speed is good enough for you or if you want to try the next one on the list

## Dependencies

This client has following dependencies:

- [python](https://python.org) (at least v3.3)
- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)

## Usage

### Install for Windows

```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/sinspired/VpngateClientPyWin.git
  cd VpngateClientPyWin
  pip install -e .
  vpngate
```

Note: `vpngate -h` for help

### Simple Case

Note: `sudo` is required for OpenVPN.

```shell
  sudo ./vpngate-client
```

This tries the VPN servers one-by-one ordered by their score and asks you to
choose the one you like.

### Filter by Country

```shell
  sudo ./vpngate-client --country CA
  sudo ./vpngate-client --us # --us is a shorthand for --country US
```

The above command only considers VPN servers in Canada. The country identifier
is a 2 digit code (ISO 3166-2).

### VPNs in Europe

```shell
  sudo ./vpngate-client --eu
```

As a special case, the `--eu` flag only considers VPN servers in Europe.

### Other Options

All the command line options are available by running `./vpngate-client --help`.
